  * Prepare, Practice, Review The Sullivan’s time-tested approach focuses students on the fundamental skills they need for the course: preparing for class, practicing with homework, and reviewing the concepts. The Enhanced with Graphing Utilities Series has evolved to meet today’s course needs by integrating the usage of graphing calculators, active-learning, and technology in new ways to help students be successful in their course, as well as in their future endeavors. In the Seventh Edition, there are several new features that appear in both the text and MyMathLab. Retain Your Knowledge problems offer the type of “final exam material” that students can use to maintain their skills throughout each chapter. Also available with MyMathLab® MyMathLab is an online homework, tutorial, and assessment program designed to work with this text to engage students and improve results. Within its structured environment, students practice what they learn, test their understanding, and pursue a personalized study plan that helps them absorb course material and understand difficult concepts.
